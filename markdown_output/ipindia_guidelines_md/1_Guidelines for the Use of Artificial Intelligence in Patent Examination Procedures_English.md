1. Introduction
1.1 Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a machine-based system that can generate outputssuchas
predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions on the basis of input data and
prompts. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is a type of AI that generates new
content, such as text, images, audio, or video, by learning patterns from input data1.
Withtherapidgrowthintheuseofgenerativetoolsacrossdifferentfields,ithasbecome
necessary to consider their use in patent examination as well. Patent examination is
document-intensive, technically complex, legally evolving and time-sensitive. Scholarly
work in the patent field shows that such tools can assist in suggesting search terms,
retrievingandrankingrelevantdocuments,visualizingcontent,andreducingthetimeand
costofscreeninglargenumbersofpatents2.Morerecentworkhasalsobeguntoexamine
their use in novelty analysis3,4.
Various policy documents issued by the Government of India5 supportastructuredand
responsible approach to the use of AI technology in public functions. Thesedocuments
recogniseitsutilityinimprovingefficiencyandpublicservicedelivery,whileemphasising
humanoversight,accountability,safety,transparency,privacy,risk-basedgovernance,and

1.2 Objective
These Guidelines are intended to guide and regulate the use of ArtificialIntelligencein
Patent examination in a manner that supports efficiency and quality, while preserving
confidentiality,accountability,consistencyandtheindependentapplicationofmindbythe
Examiner or Controller.
1.3 Scope
TheseGuidelinesshallapplytotheuseofArtificialIntelligenceinPatentexaminationtasks
such as screening, classification, search, translation support, drafting support, technical
comparison or knowledge retrieval.
2. Terminologies
2.1 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
ArtificialIntelligencemeansamachine-basedsystemcapableofgeneratingoutputssuchas
predictions,recommendations,classifications,summaries,orcontentonthebasisofinput
data along with prompts.
2.2 AI prompt
An AI prompt is a specific text, command, image, or query provided to an artificial
intelligence model to guide it in producing a desired output.
2.3 Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI)
Generative Artificial Intelligence means any Artificial Intelligence system capable of
generatingtext,images,summaries,explanations,orothercontentinresponsetoprompts
or instructions.

2.5 Public AI tools
An AI tool or application that is accessible to the public through free or commercially
available means, including both free-tier and paid versions of consumer-facing AI
platforms. Such tools are trained on large and diverse datasets from publicly available
sources, including text, images, audio,video,andotherdigitalcontent.Thismakesthem

Public AI for assistance in patent examination.
2.6 Private AI tools
Private AI tools refer to artificial intelligence systems operating in closed or restricted
environments, often trained on proprietary or controlled datasets. Such systems are
typicallyownedandmanagedbyspecificentitieswhocontrolthedatafeedingthesystem

closed with heightened security measures to safeguard against unauthorized access.
2.7 AI-assisted output
AI-assisted output refers to content, decisions or products generated through a
collaborative process where AI tools are used to enhance, speed uporaugmenthuman
work. Unlike fully automated output generation by AI tools, AI-assisted output involves
"humanintheloop",meaningapersonprovidesdirection,context,andoversight,ensuring
the final result meets specific quality and intended standards.
2.8 Prompt Engineering
“PromptengineeringistheartandscienceofdesigningandoptimizingpromptstoguideAI
models,particularlyLLMs,towardsgeneratingthedesiredresponses.Bycarefullycrafting
prompts, you provide the model with context, instructions and examples that help it
understand your intent and respond in a meaningful way. Think of it as providing a
roadmap for the AI, steering it towards the specific output you have in mind.”6

3.LimitationsandriskswhileusingAItoolsandtheneedfor
human oversight
3.1 Limitations and Risks
CommonwaysinwhichArtificialIntelligencemaymakemistakesaregivenbelow.These
emphasizetheneedforthoroughhumanoversight.ThefollowingarenotexhaustiveasAI
is fast evolving and new risks are also identified during the process.
3.1.1ProfileSensitivity: TheoutputofAItoolsmaybeinfluencedbypriorinteractions,
past prompts or user-specific contextual patterns. This may result in responses being
shapednotonlybytheimmediateprompt,butalsobytheuser’searlierusagehistory.Such
profilingmayaffecttheveracity,neutrality,consistencyandpredictabilityoftheoutputand
should therefore be kept in mind while usingAItoolsforofficialwork.Accordingly,the
output must be independently assessed.
3.1.2 Prompt Discipline:
Apart from such profiling-related influence, the quality,
relevance and direction ofAI-generatedoutputarealsomateriallyshapedbythewayin
whichthepromptisframed.Promptdisciplinemeansthecarefulandstructuredframingof
promptssothattherequestmadetoanAItoolisclear,precise,relevantandlimitedtothe
intendedpurpose.Itinvolvesdefiningthetaskproperly,providingthenecessarycontext,
specifying the expected form of output where required, and avoiding unnecessary
misleadingcontent.ThisisimportantbecauseAI-generatedoutputisofteninfluencedby
the wording, scope, and structure of the prompt. For example, a vague prompt suchas
“analysethispatentclaim”mayproduceabroadorunfocusedresponse,whereasamore
disciplinedpromptsuchas“identifythekeytechnicalfeaturesofthisclaimandgenerate
possiblesearchtermsforprior-artsearch”ismorelikelytoproduceacontrolledanduseful

3.1.3HallucinationorFabrication:TheAItoolsmaypresentaconfidentbutunsupported
statement, citation, explanation, or mapping. Such hallucinations may be extrinsic or
intrinsic.AnintrinsichallucinationoccurswhentheAItoolgeneratesinformationthatis
notpresentintheprovidedcontext,therebyfabricatingfactstofillaknowledgegap. An
intrinsic hallucination occurs where the AI tool is given specific source documents or
contextintheprompt,butitsoutputcontradicts,distortsormisrepresentsthatprovided
information.
In the context of patents, hallucinations may include non-existent prior art, fabricated
judgments, contradicting claims,scopeetc.GenerativeAItoolsgenerallyprovidelinksto

authenticityandreliability.AnyresourcecitedbyAIshallbecross-checkedfromauthorised
sourcesliketheoriginalpublisher,orotherreliablesourcesbyconductingfreshsearchon
the internet, so as to avoid the risk of adopting a citation that does not exist in reality.
WhereAIisusedinrelationtocitedmaterial,itsoutputshallbecomparedwiththeoriginal
source to ensure that the source has not been misrepresented. This is particularly
importantinthecaseofjudicialprecedents,sinceeachjudgmentmustbeunderstoodinthe
contextofthefactsandcircumstancesinwhichitwasdelivered.AImaymisreadtheratio,
overstate the principle laid down, or apply it incorrectly to adifferentfactualsituation.
Human judgment therefore remains essential in understanding and applying precedents.
3.1.4 Omission of Critical Detail: The AI tool may miss a limiting claim feature, an
amendment, a disclaimer, a qualifier or a technical relationship.
3.1.5 False Pattern Matching: The AI toolmayidentifysurfacesimilarityandoverlook
legal or technical differences that matter. A document may appear relevant based on
keywordsorsemanticsimilaritywhilebeinglegallyortechnicallyirrelevanttotheclaim
under examination.
3.1.6 Loss of Technical Context: The AI tool may summarise or translate a passage
without preserving its exact technical meaning.
3.1.7ClassificationandSearchDrift:AImaysuggestclassificationsthatarebroaderthan
warranted,orsearchtermsthatintroducelargeamountsofirrelevantpriorart,diverting
theexaminationfromthecorrecttechnicalfield.Classificationandsearchtermoutputsare
sensitive to the model used, the prompt framing, and the conditioning parameters.
3.1.8Over-breadthorOver-narrowness:TheAItoolmayexpandaconcepttoowidelyor
interpret it too narrowly, thereby distorting search or classification.
3.1.9 Black-box Opacity: The officer may not know why a particular suggestion was
made, which makes verification and accountability more difficult.
3.1.10 Confidentiality Risk: The convenience of anexternaltoolmayleadtoimproper
sharing of unpublished or internal material.
3.1.11Misguidance:Evenwheretheoutputisnotwhollyfabricated,thesystemmaystill
guide the user in a wrong direction by suggesting an unsuitable classification path, an
irrelevant search approach, a weak comparison, or an unsound line of reasoning. Such
misguidance may be particularly difficult to detect where the output appears fluent,
structured, and persuasive.

Artificial Intelligence  
in Patent Examination Procedure 
 
 
Note: These illustrative examples are not intended to offer guidance on prompt engineering techniques or best practices for 
the use of AI tools, nor to give advice on training AI models for specific tasks. Users may adopt any suitable prompts of their

Illustrative Examples of Use of Artificial Intelligence in Patent Examination 
1.1 Use of AI for identifying candidate IPC classifications 
AI is a useful tool to identify classification codes relevant for an invention. But human oversight remains necessary while using 
AI for arriving at reasoned and final classification. This can be illustrated with the following examples: 
Example 1: Variability observed in AI-assisted patent classification when different models, prompts, and conditioning 
parameters are employed for 2 patent applications (Classifications shown in red are irrelevant classifications.)

The above table provides a consolidated comparison of IPC/CPC classifications generated by various AI tools (Columns 1-6, 8, 
and 9) with the manually assigned classifications (Columns 10 and 11) for two patent applications. The prompt used for all AI 
tools was: “Find the appropriate IPC Classification for the text provided below, (followed by the text of Independent Claim 1)”. 
To further refine the classifications, a set of conditions (1-31), as detailed below, was provided to AI Tool 1. However, the 
classifications assigned (Column 7) by the tool still included erroneous classifications. 
[Conditions given:  1. Always analyse ALL claims critically, not selectively. 2. Classification must be strictly CLAIM-DRIVEN. Do 
not classify based on title, abstract, background, or examples. 3. Multiple IPC and CPC codes are allowed wherever genuinely 
applicable. 4. IPC codes must be taken ONLY from official IPC lists. 5. CPC codes must be taken ONLY from official CPC scheme 
lists. 6. IPC and CPC must NEVER be cross-used: - CPC subgroups must not be shown as IPC. - IPC codes must remain at valid 
IPC hierarchy levels. 7. Before giving any code, ALWAYS cross-check that the code exists in the respective IPC or CPC scheme. 8. 
If a code exists only in CPC, keep it ONLY in CPC. 9. Do not invent, modify, or assume any IPC or CPC code. 10. Use only those 
codes that are truly necessary and supported by claims. 11. Avoid over-classification and speculative classification. 12. Exclude 
any code that is: - Only descriptive - Only contextual - Based on application field instead of claimed structure/function 13. 
Prefer dominant technical fields over auxiliary features. 14. Distinguish between: - Core invention - Auxiliary or supporting 
features 15. Always justify why each code is selected. 16. Always justify why other possible codes are excluded. 17. Use 
examiner-style, neutral, technical reasoning. 18. Provide results strictly in tables. 19. Tables must include: - Title of document - 
IPC codes (comma separated) - CPC codes (comma separated) - Examination Department from Annexure IPC - Department 
from Google using IPC 20. Provide a second table mapping: - Claim numbers - Core feature - Technical aspect - IPC code(s) - 
CPC code(s) - Short justification 21. Keep explanations concise and technical. 22. Do not use shortcuts, assumptions, or 
convenience codes. 23. Always perform a fresh analysis. 24. Do not reuse earlier conclusions. 25. Always cross-check against 
today's official scheme structure. 26. IPC classification must follow the principle: "Classify what is claimed, not what it is used 
for." 27. CPC classification must only refine IPC, not contradict it. 28. When errors are identified (e.g., wrong code, non-existent 
IPC), discard and redo analysis from scratch. 29. Do not mix mechanical, electrical, civil, or software domains unless claims 
clearly justify multiple domains. 30. Always maintain examiner-safe discipline. 31. Always keep the output suitable for FER / 
office examination use. save this for future reference and analysis.] 
The example indicates that AI-assisted classification is AI model/prompt/conditions -sensitive.Depending on the model used, 
the generated classification may either remain closer to the human assigned classification or move towards broader and or 
irrelevant classifications.Therefore human oversight is invariably essential.

❖​ The comparison indicates that the IPC suggestions are model-sensitive, both in terms of the number of symbols 
suggested and the technical direction reflected in such suggestions. It also indicates a certain degree of inconsistency 
across the models for the same application. 
❖​ The IPC suggestions generated by the GenAI models are, in some cases, close to the IPCs assigned manually by the 
Classification Team, but they are not identical. 
❖​ Though based on a limited sample, the comparison indicates that human judgment continues to remain necessary in 
each case. This is because final classification requires a considered reading of the claims and specification, identification 
of the most appropriate technical focus of the invention.  
❖​ Where the suggested classification lacks precision, if relied upon without human oversight, it can potentially affect the 
quality of search and examination since it may either broaden the search unnecessarily or divert it towards a different 
technical direction.

1.2. Use of AI for generating search terms and concept clusters 
An Examiner may use AI to generate synonyms, abbreviations, related technical expressions, alternative spellings, and concept 
clusters for a claimed invention. This helps in broadening a search by identifying related technical expressions, synonyms, 
variant terminologies and closely connected concepts around the claimed subject matter. This can be useful as often the 
terminology varies across patent literature, standards, academic writing, or foreign-language material. 
The benefit is obvious. AI may widen the officer’s search vocabulary and help identify related terminology more quickly. This 
supports efficiency and search completeness. 
But AI may also make mistakes here. It may suggest terms that are technically adjacent but legally irrelevant. It may 
over-broaden the search by mixing different technologies under a superficial common label. It may also over-narrow the 
search by assuming that one term is equivalent to another when the claim language is more specific. In a chemical, 
pharmaceutical, or materials case, one wrong synonym may introduce large amounts of irrelevant art or, worse, exclude 
relevant prior art. 
The safeguard is that AI-generated search terms should only be a starting aid. The Examiner must construct the final search 
strategy. The officer must test and refine the terms using the claim language, the specification, classification symbols, and the 
actual search results.  
The following illustrates the use of Artificial Intelligence in the generation of search vocabulary 
Example 1 
Illustrative claim 
A water treatment composition for removal of arsenic from contaminated water, the composition comprising activated carbon 
supporting magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, wherein the magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have an average particle size of 
10 nm to 30 nm, and wherein the composition is adapted to adsorb arsenic species present in the contaminated water.

Purpose of the exercise 
The purpose of this exercise was to examine whether GenAI models may assist an Examiner in generating an initial search 
vocabulary for prior-art search, and to observe the extent to which different models converge or diverge in the search terms 
suggested for the same claim. 
Prompt given to the GenAI models 
The GenAI models were asked to generate search terminology on the basis of the above claim under the following broad heads: 
●​ core search terms; 
●​ near synonyms; 
●​ related technical expressions; 
●​ broader exploratory terms; and 
●​ terms to avoid (because they may misdirect the search.)

Comparative observations 
This exercise indicates that both GenAI models were able to identify the principal technical elements of the claim, namely 
activated carbon, magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, arsenic removal from water, and adsorption-based treatment. At the same 
time, the models differed in the breadth, structure, and technical direction of the terms suggested. 
Page 9 of 34

---

The exercise therefore indicates that AI-generated search vocabulary is model-sensitive, both in terms of the number of terms 
suggested and the extent to which the output expands into adjacent technical areas. Depending on the model used, the 
generated vocabulary may either remain closer to the immediate claim language or move towards broader and neighbouring 
technical domains. 
The exercise indicates that GenAI may assist in generating an initial search vocabulary, but the final search strategy still 
requires human judgment. This is because the Examiner must determine: 
●​ which terms remain sufficiently close to the claimed subject matter; 
●​ which expressions are technically adjacent but legally or functionally different; 
●​ which broader terms may be used selectively for exploratory search; and 
●​ which terms may introduce large amounts of irrelevant prior art or move the search into neighbouring but non-relevant 
technical areas. 
In the present example, the AI outputs were useful in identifying the central search concepts and certain alternative technical 
expressions. At the same time, some of the broader expressions, if used without control, could widen the search beyond the 
claimed combination of activated carbon + magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles + arsenic adsorption from water. Human 
oversight therefore remains necessary to convert AI-generated vocabulary into a reasoned and targeted search strategy.

1.3. Use of AI for preliminary claim-feature extraction 
An Examiner/Controller may use AI to break an independent claim into separate features or claim elements for convenience. 
This may help in preparing internal notes or a comparison chart. 
The benefit is that AI can quickly convert long claims into a structured list and may therefore help the Examiner organise the 
analysis. This can be useful in complex mechanical, telecom, software, or biotechnology claims. 
The danger is that AI may split the claim incorrectly. It may separate features that legally belong together. It may ignore 
relational phrases such as “configured to,” “in response to,” “wherein,” or “such that.” It may also miss negative limitations, 
numerical ranges, functional dependencies, or optional and mandatory elements. In patent examination, such errors are 
serious, because a wrong claim breakdown can distort novelty and inventive step analysis from the very beginning. 
The safeguard is that any AI-generated feature list should be treated only as a rough internal draft. The Officer must revise it 
personally before it is used for any comparison exercise. The status of this use may therefore be treated as restricted, because 
it may materially influence later reasoning if left unchecked. 
1.4. Use of AI for translation support 
An Examiner/ Controller may use AI to obtain a rough understanding of a foreign-language document, especially for early 
search screening or internal orientation. 
The benefit is that the officer may quickly understand whether a Japanese, Chinese, Korean, German, or other foreign-language 
document is likely to be relevant. This may improve the speed of search review and reduce dependence on slower manual 
routes for initial screening. The risk, however, is that AI translation may miss technical nuance. A word that means “coupled,” 
“bonded,” “attached,” “linked,” or “mounted” may not be interchangeable in an engineering context. The safeguard is that AI 
translation may be used for rough understanding, but any passage relied upon for a formal objection should be checked from a 
reliable source like drawings  related to the invention. It shall be mentioned clearly in the reasoning on patentability that a 
machine translation of the citation was relied upon.

1.5. Use of AI for improving the structure or language of a draft office communication 
AI tools are found to have the potential to improve coherence, grammar, remove repetition or contradictions, reorganise 
headings, or convert raw notes into a cleaner draft. The tools can assist in summarization of lengthy documents for internal 
reading convenience.  
The benefit is better presentation, readability, and concise expression. In principle, this may help improve consistency in office 
writing and reduce purely clerical effort. The danger arises when the system moves beyond such support and begins 
generating reasoning. It may insert statements not found in the record, overstate the scope of a prior-art document, weaken 
the logic of an objection, or omit the officer’s actual reasoning chain. It may also produce language that sounds correct but is 
legally imprecise. An even more serious risk is the inclusion of non-existent  citations or  case references, or unsupported 
propositions. 
The safeguard is that AI may be used to improve language or structure of a draft already prepared by the officer, but not to 
replace the officer’s own reasoning. No official communication should be issued unless the officer has personally checked 
every substantive statement. Any AI-assisted technical summary shall be checked against the actual record.Language support 
may therefore be permitted for formatting and language refinement, but restricted for substantive reasoning. 
GenAI outputs generally suggest further ways in which the AI tool can support and also some introductory lines from the AI 
tool. While adopting AI generated language, care may be taken to avoid such casual inputs as this could adversely affect the 
credibility of the official communication even when the substantive report is correct and human endorsed. Examples are “Here 
are a few ways to reword your communication, depending on the tone you want to set:” or “Would you like me to adjust the tone to 
be even more formal, or perhaps focus more on the "novelty" aspect in this case?”

1.6. Use of AI to retrieve legal or technical citations 
An officer may seek to use  AI for case law, scientific references, patent citations, or excerpts from manuals relevant to a 
particular objection. The apparent advantage of such use lies in  convenience,as the system may generate well-presented  
output.  However, such output may not be dependable. AI may fabricate citations, confuse one judgment with another, 
misdescribe the ratio, or attribute technical findings to a source that never made them. In a patent examination setting, use of a 
fabricated or wrongly described authority can directly affect the credibility and defensibility of the office action. 
The safeguard is independent verification of source /output with utmost care. No citation  suggested by AI should be used 
unless it is independently verified and checked in the actual source. 
1.7. Use of a public generative AI tool with unpublished patent application material 
An officer shall not copy the claims, description, prior-art note, hearing note or unpublished document into a public AI tool to 
obtain a summary, chart, or draft. The Indian government policy repeatedly emphasises data protection and confidentiality. 
Use of a public generative AI tool with unpublished patent application  creates a risk that unpublished subject matter, internal 
comments, or other sensitive official material may move outside the approved environment. In the patent context, that would 
amount to a serious institutional/stakeholder risk. The status of this use should therefore be treated as prohibited.

1.8. Use of AI tools for preliminary novelty or inventive step analysis 
Use of Artificial Intelligence for the generation of novelty objections, inventive step objections, or hearing notices on the basis 
of the claims and cited documents shall be done with careful precautions only. The system may fail to identify a distinguishing 
feature, misread the cited document, combine separate teachings impermissibly, apply hindsight, or generate reasoning that 
appears persuasive in language but is technically unsound. It may also fail to deal fairly and accurately with the submissions 
made by the applicant. More importantly, such use may weaken the independent application of mind required of the Examiner 
or Controller. The Indian policy framework likewise emphasises human oversight, documentation, and risk-based safeguards 
where rights are involved. The use of AI tools for novelty/inventive step analysis is to be done with caution as the detailed 
one-to-one claim mapping necessary for novelty analysis, which requires careful consideration of explicit and implicit 
disclosures along with drawings and contextual information, makes the process particularly challenging; and prone to huge 
amount of errors and significant omissions.  
Example 1: 
Claim 1: A laparoscopic needle holder comprising: a tubular shaft, the shaft having a straight proximal shaft section and a 
curved distal shaft section; clamping jaws disposed at a distal end of the shaft; a handle disposed at a proximal end of the shaft; 
and a rod that passes through a center of the shaft, the rod capable of being longitudinally displaced by the handle to actuate 
the clamping jaws, wherein the straight proximal shaft section and the curved distal shaft section are detachably attached to 
one another. 
Prior Art D1: A suturing device for use with a suturing needle, the device comprising: a body having a proximal end and a distal 
end, the body having an elongate extension extending along an axis toward the distal end, the extension configured to define a 
bend in the axis; a first clamp near the distal end of the body; a linkage effecting a movement of the first clamp between a 
grasping configuration and a released configuration, the first clamp configured for grasping the needle in the grasping 
configuration and the needle being released in the released configuration, the linkage comprising a shaft movable along the 
axis within the extension so as to effect the movement of the first clamp, the shaft having axial stiffness and being laterally 
flexible so as to transmit the movement and accommodate the bend.

---

Prompt : Compare Claim 1 with Prior Art D1 and explain whether Claim 1 lacks novelty. Focus on whether D1 already 
discloses the same overall laparoscopic needle holder structure, including a shaft/body with straight and curved portions, 
distal clamping jaws, proximal actuation, and an internal rod/linkage for actuating the jaws. Treat the proximal and distal shaft 
portions in D1 as parts of the same attached instrument structure. Give the conclusion in paragraph form. 
Gen AI response 1:  
“Claim 1 lacks novelty over D1, as D1 already discloses a needle holding/suturing device having a shaft/body with proximal and 
distal portions, the distal portion being bent, a distal clamp for holding the needle, and an inner shaft/linkage movable 
longitudinally within the bent extension to actuate the clamp. Thus, D1 teaches the claimed tubular shaft having a straight 
proximal section and a curved distal section, clamping jaws at the distal end, a proximal actuation handle arrangement, and a rod 
passing through the shaft to actuate the jaws. The proximal and distal shaft portions in D1 are parts of the same instrument 
structure attached to one another, and therefore the claim does not define any feature that is novel over D1. Hence, claim 1 is not 
novel.” 
Prompt: Compare Claim 1 with Prior Art D1 and explain whether Claim 1 is novel. Focus particularly on the feature that the 
straight proximal shaft section and the curved distal shaft section are detachably attached to one another. Assess whether D1 
clearly and directly discloses this detachable attachment feature. If D1 only discloses a bent extension or continuous body and 
not detachable shaft sections, explain why Claim 1 remains novel. Give the conclusion in paragraph form. 
Gen AI response 2:  
“Claim 1 is novel over D1. While D1 discloses a suturing device having an elongate body with a bent distal portion, a distal clamp, 
and a shaft/linkage movable along the axis to actuate the clamp, D1 does not disclose the specific construction now claimed, 
namely, a tubular shaft having a straight proximal shaft section and a curved distal shaft section, wherein the straight proximal 
shaft section and the curved distal shaft section are detachably attached to one another. The cited prior art merely teaches an 
extension configured to define a bend, but does not teach or suggest that the proximal and distal shaft sections are formed as 
separate detachable components. Since this distinguishing structural feature is absent in D1, all the features of claim 1 are not 
disclosed therein, and therefore claim 1 satisfies the requirement of novelty.” 
Page 18 of 34

Note: AI responses may not always be consistent or reproducible. 
In the present example, both responses appear, prima facie, to be fluent and persuasive. The difference between them appears 
to lie in the treatment of the detachable attachment feature. This illustrates the need for independent human scrutiny. All AI 
outputs must be critically reviewed and validated by a qualified human professional using primary sources. Due diligence is 
mandatory.  
 
Page 19 of 34

At the same time, AI may still be useful at the preliminary stage in identifying possible claim-to-prior-art mapping and in 
organising the comparison in a structured manner. Such mapping, however, can only be treated as an assistive input. It remains 
for the Examiner or Controller to verify each mapped feature from the actual prior-art document, assess whether the 
correspondence is technically and legally correct, and arrive at an independent conclusion on novelty.

1.9. Use of AI for quick identification of clarity issues in claims 
Example 1: 
Consider you have uploaded the following claim into an AI (assisted) tool: 
“A composition comprising: (a) rutin; and (b) wedelolactone, wherein weight percentage of rutin and wedelolactone in said 
composition is in the range of 0.03-0.57%, and rutin to wedelolactone w/w ratio in said composition is in the range of 1:1-1:9.” 
Prompt-1: identify clarity issues as per section 10(4) of the Act for the claim. 
Response of AI tool:   
“Claim 1 defines: weight percentage of rutin and wedelolactone as “0.03–0.57%” ratio as “1:1–1:9” However, it is unclear 
whether: the percentage refers to each component individually, combined concentration of both components, or percentage 
with respect to total composition weight”.  
AI Flag: “Ambiguous quantitative limitation detected.” 
Prompt-2: draft in a FER style. 
Response of AI tool:  
“[Suggested FER Language : The claims lack clarity under Section 10(4) of the Act as the expression “weight percentage of 
rutin and wedelolactone in said composition is in the range of 0.03-0.57%” fails to clearly define whether the stated 
percentage relates to each individual component or the combined amount of both components in the composition.]” 
Prompt-3: consider it is combined weight percentage of rutin and wedelolactone in the composition. 
 
 
Page 22 of 34

---

Response of AI tool:  
“[In that case, the ambiguity objection may be modified as follows: The claims lack clarity under Section 10(4) of the Act as the 
expression “weight percentage of rutin and wedelolactone in said composition is in the range of 0.03–0.57%” does not clearly 
specify the individual amount or concentration range attributable to each component within the claimed composition, thereby 
rendering the scope of the claim unclear. 
Or more mildly: 
Although the claims indicate that the stated percentage refers to the combined amount of rutin and wedelolactone in the 
composition, the individual quantitative contribution of each component remains unclear in view of the broad ratio range of 
1:1–1:9, thereby affecting clarity and definiteness under Section 10(4) of the Act.]” 
Prompt-4: claim doesn't mention what constitutes the remaining 99.43-99.97% in the composition. include this observation 
Response of AI tool:  
“[The claims lack clarity under Section 10(4) of the Act as claim 1 merely defines that the combined weight percentage of rutin 
and wedelolactone in the composition is in the range of 0.03–0.57%, without clearly specifying the nature and composition of 
the remaining 99.43–99.97% of the claimed composition. Further, in view of the broad rutin to wedelolactone ratio range of 
1:1–1:9, the individual quantitative contribution of each component also remains unclear, thereby rendering the scope and 
boundaries of the claimed composition indefinite.]” 
Usability of AI: 
AI assists the user in promptly identifying ambiguities and potential deficiencies requiring clarification under Section 10(4) of 
the Act. It may be utilised as a supportive tool for preliminary issue identification, claim analysis, and drafting assistance. 
However, the final determination regarding legal interpretation, statutory compliance, and formulation of objections shall 
remain solely within the domain of the user.

1.10. Use of AI tools for preliminary assessment of sufficiency of disclosure 
 
Example 1: 
Prompt: assess the sufficiency of disclosure of an application as per the Patent Act. ‘complete specification attached’.  
Response:  
“The specification is marginally/borderline sufficient for enablement under typical patent law standards (e.g., Indian Patents 
Act §10(4) or equivalent enablement requirements), but it is functionally high-level and lacks granular implementation details 
that could invite objections or challenges. 
Key Elements Adequately Disclosed 
The description fully explains: 
●​ Core inventive concept and principle: Depth of anesthesia (DOA) and level of consciousness are derived from the 
magnitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) extracted from ECG-derived R-R intervals (RRIs). Muscle relaxation is 
derived from the correlation of spectral power in HRV peaks 1 (baroreceptor ~0.1 Hz) and 2 (respiratory). RSA 
magnitude is stated to be (inversely) proportional to DOA; graphs in Figures 5 and 6 illustrate real-world behavior with 
specific anesthetics, muscle relaxants, and pain testing (VAS correlation). 
●​ Hardware implementation: 
○​ 3-lead ECG pickup channel (or direct from existing ECG monitor “OUT” terminal) with high input impedance 
(10× normal ECG). 
○​ QRS detection filter: special bandpass + adjustable-Q notch at 50/60 Hz; lower cutoff “slightly below 20 Hz” to 
reject baseline wander/cable movement while preserving QRS train (explicitly contrasted with full ECG in Figure 
3). 
○​ Front-panel controls: power LED, normal/invert switch, QRS/ECG mode switch, heartbeat LED + potentiometer 
for dynamic threshold/noise assessment (no oscilloscope needed). 
○​ Simple block diagram (Figure 2) and serial-port interface to PC. 
Page 24 of 34

---

●​ Overall system workflow (Figures 1–6 support this): 
○​ QRS train → digitize RRIs → compute HRV spectrum → auto-detect peaks 1 & 2 → form adaptive bandpass 
“following contour of peak-2” → filter RRI series → decimate in time + average → RSA magnitude (and 
relaxation from peak-power correlation). 
○​ Real-time graphical/numerical display of RSA (consciousness) and relaxation, updated every ~2 minutes; 
baseline wander rejection and noise handling are addressed. 
●​ Advantages and practical use: Non-invasive, low-cost, uses only ECG, works in real-time during surgery/post-op pain, 
robust to movement/cables. 
These elements, combined with common general knowledge in biomedical engineering/HRV analysis (standard RRI extraction, 
FFT-based spectra, respiratory vs. baroreceptor bands), would allow a person of ordinary skill in the art (POSITA: biomedical 
signal-processing engineer + anesthesiologist) to build a working prototype without reinventing the wheel. 
Critical Deficiencies (Potential Enablement Gaps) 
The specification is vague or silent on several key aspects of the novel signal-processing core: 
●​ QRS detection filter: Called a “special combination” of bandpass + adjustable-Q notch. No exact cutoff frequencies 
(upper/lower), filter order/type, component values, circuit schematic, or precise Q-adjustment range. Trade-off 
between noise rejection and QRS amplitude is mentioned qualitatively only. 
●​ Algorithmic details (the heart of the invention): 
○​ HRV spectrum computation (FFT parameters, windowing, resampling of uneven RRIs, number of intervals 
required, frequency resolution?). 
○​ Automatic peak detection for peaks 1 and 2. 
○​ Exact meaning of “bandpass filter formed following the contour of peak-2” and how the filter coefficients/gain 
are dynamically generated. 
○​ “Decimated in time” and “some sort of average” for RSA magnitude — no decimation factor, averaging method, or 
formula. 
Page 25 of 34

---

○​ “Correlation of powers in the peaks 1 and 2” for muscle relaxation — no mathematical definition (ratio? Pearson 
correlation? weighted sum?). 
○​ Scaling/mapping of raw RSA/relaxation values to displayed numerical/graphical DOA indices (no calibration, 
normalization, or patient-specific handling). 
●​ Software/PC side: No pseudocode, flowcharts, equations, sampling rates, serial protocol, update timing details, or 
source code. Only “special hardware & software combination package” is mentioned. 
●​ No best mode: No specific preferred circuit values, filter coefficients, or exact parameters that the inventors used in 
their working prototype. 
●​ Quantitative validation: Examples in Figures 5–6 are qualitative; no thresholds, reproducibility data, or error margins. 
Phrases such as “special combination,” “automatically detected,” and “some sort of average” are functional but not enabling at 
the level of detail typically required for the inventive step (the ECG-only RSA-based monitor with custom QRS filtering and 
adaptive spectral processing). 
Overall Assessment 
●​ For broad functional claims (as in the “Statement of the Invention”): Likely sufficient. A skilled artisan could implement 
a version that performs the claimed functions using routine experimentation and standard DSP/HRV toolkits. 
●​ For narrow or precise claims (e.g., specific filter parameters, exact RSA magnitude algorithm, or “precise/reliable” 
performance matching the examples): Insufficient. Undue experimentation would be required to replicate the 
inventors’ results without reverse-engineering or trial-and-error tuning. 
●​ Jurisdictional note: In lenient systems this might pass; in stricter ones (e.g., India, EPO post-Biogen type scrutiny for 
complex signal-processing inventions) an examiner could issue an objection under lack of sufficiency/enablement, 
especially since the software/algorithmic part is the true novelty over prior art (EEG/EMG/respiration-based 
monitors). 
The specification excels at conveying the idea and high-level architecture but falls short of a “clear and complete” blueprint for 
the person skilled in the art to perform the invention exactly as contemplated by the inventors without substantial further 
development. No additional pages, schematics, equations, or code appear in the PDF beyond what is summarised above.” 
Page 26 of 34

---

From the above example it can be seen that the AI output is useful for indicating insufficiency but it can be again inferred that 
human oversight in use of AI becomes important because responses like this can sow the seeds of confusion. 
Example 2: 
A Gen AI tool was prompted to assess the sufficiency of disclosure of an application as per the Patent Act. 
 
The application and the drawing, both in PDF format, were uploaded and prompted to check for sufficiency of disclosure. (The 
application was refused by IPO on insufficiency grounds in the year 2016). 
 
The First response: 
“What the Application Claims and Purports to Disclose 
The invention is a device that links five (or more) wind turbines to one specially adapted generator using a “special gears-and-rods 
mechanism” so that all turbines rotate synchronously in the same direction. This allegedly achieves: 
●​ Activation at lower wind speeds, and 
●​ Four-fold increase in power output at reduced overall cost. 
The text repeatedly states that the “exactly how” the critical gears-and-rods mechanism works “is shown in Fig. 2” 
(horizontal-axis) and “Fig. 4” (vertical-axis). Figures 1–4 are now available and show the overall assembly and linkages. 
Why the Disclosure Remains Insufficient 
1.​ The core inventive feature — the “special gears-and-rods mechanism” — is not adequately described 
○​ The text gives zero constructional details. 
○​ The drawings (Figs. 2 and 4 especially) are crude, hand-sketched schematics showing only the general idea of 
angled rods, implied bevel gears, and rotary connections. 
Page 27 of 34

---

○​ Missing: gear ratios, tooth profiles, backlash control, bearing types and placements, shaft alignments, torque 
transmission details, how perpendicular turbines avoid mechanical interference, materials, dimensions, tolerances, 
or any manufacturing/assembly instructions. 
2.​ Drawings are too rudimentary to enable the invention 
○​ No scales, dimensions, or proportions. 
○​ No structural supports, yaw-control mechanisms, or details on how the auxiliary turbines remain properly oriented 
to the wind while mechanically locked to the central shaft. 
○​ No indication of how the linkages handle simultaneous synchronous rotation of five turbines without binding or loss 
of efficiency. 
3.​ The “specially created/adapted generator” is undefined. The text claims it is less expensive and high-capacity, yet provides 
no design details, windings, ratings, or differences from a conventional generator. 
4.​ Claims are far broader than the disclosure. Claim 1 covers “two, three, four, five or more wind turbines linked … by gears of 
any sort and rods/chains/belts/shafts”. The specification describes only one vague embodiment with five turbines and a 
single unspecified “gears-and-rods” system. There is no support for this breadth. 
5.​ Other enabling gaps 
○​ No quantitative data (expected power gain, cut-in speed reduction, efficiency calculations, etc.). 
○​ No best method of performing the invention. 
○​ Minor but confusing inconsistencies in the text (e.g., mislabelling of horizontal vs. vertical axis figures)”. 
 
A second prompt was given: what if the applicant argues that “special gears-and-rods mechanism” is well known in the art 
 
The response: “No — even if the applicant argues that the “special gears-and-rods mechanism” is well known in the art, the 
application is still NOT sufficiently disclosed under Section 10(4) of the Patents Act, 1970. 
Legal Position 
Section 10(4) requires the complete specification to: 
Page 28 of 34

---

●​ fully and particularly describe the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed, and 
●​ disclose the best method known to the applicant. 
A person skilled in the art (POSITA — a mechanical/wind-turbine engineer of ordinary skill) must be able to carry out the 
invention without undue experimentation using only the specification, drawings, and common general knowledge (CGK) available 
at the filing date. 
Mere assertion by the applicant that a critical feature is “well known” does not automatically satisfy this requirement. 
Why the Argument Fails in This Case 
The specification itself treats the mechanism as something that needs to be shown in the drawings 
1.​ The text repeatedly states:​
“Exactly how this gears-and-rods mechanism transfers the various individual wind energies to shaft 6 is shown in Fig. 2” 
(and similarly for Fig. 4).​
This directly contradicts any later claim that the mechanism is simply “well known” and needs no further description. The 
applicant cannot have it both ways. 
The word “special” undermines the “well-known” argument 
2.​ The specification repeatedly calls it a “special gears-and-rods mechanism”. The adjective “special” implies it is not an 
ordinary, off-the-shelf, or commonly known arrangement. Using “special” while simultaneously claiming it is well known 
creates an internal inconsistency that weakens the applicant’s position. 
No specific reference to any known prior art or standard technique 
3.​ The specification does not cite any textbook, prior patent, industry standard, or common engineering practice. It does not 
say “using the well-known bevel-gear-and-rod linkage as described in XYZ” or anything similar. A POSITA reading the 
document in 2008 would not know which particular gears-and-rods arrangement is being referred to. 
The drawings remain too vague to rely on CGK 
Page 29 of 34

---

4.​ Even with the four hand-drawn sheets, Figs. 2 and 4 are crude schematics showing only the general concept of angled rods 
and implied bevel gears. They lack: 
○​ Gear ratios, tooth profiles, or meshing details 
○​ Bearing types, shaft alignments, or supports 
○​ Any indication of how synchronous same-direction rotation of five turbines (positioned in perpendicular planes) is 
achieved without binding or interference 
○​ Materials, dimensions, or assembly instructions 
5.​ Common general knowledge in 2008 included standard wind-turbine gearboxes (planetary, bevel, etc.) and some 
experimental multi-rotor concepts, but not this specific 5-turbine cross-linked synchronous coupling system. 
The mechanism is the core inventive feature 
6.​ The entire claimed advantage (lower cut-in speed + four-fold power increase from one generator) depends on this linkage 
working reliably. When the key enabling feature is left vague, reliance on undefined “well-known” knowledge is not 
permitted”. 
 
In the above example, the AI tool was able to prove the insufficiency and was found to align with the real case where the 
application was refused on ground of insufficiency.

Important Note: To get the exact verbatim quotes, you’ll need to consult the full text judgment via databases such as CaseMine 
or Manupatra. The open-access summaries only paraphrase the reasoning. 
This is a typical example of Fabricated Verbatim Quotations (a severe form of Extrinsic Hallucination combined with 
Misattribution) wherein an AI tool was asked to provide ‘verbatim quotations’. The response was generated without having 
access to the primary source and was presented as ‘verbatim quotations’ which is factually incorrect. Only after repeated 
prompts about the veracity of the ‘verbatim quotations’ the AI tool confessed to having constructed and shown them as 
‘verbatim quotations’ from secondary sources.   
The model may construct plausible-sounding quotes from secondary knowledge or pure generation and confidently attribute 
them as word-for-word extracts. Such outputs must never be trusted without direct verification against the actual primary 
document. This is a kind of situation exactly what an AI user needs to always keep in mind while seeking AI-assisted output. 
This may be considered as a good example, why extreme caution is required in using AI tools.
